# Calories Prediction project :
In this Repo , I have done a Project on machine learning Regression Project on Calories prediction problem statement Which requires a Huge dataset where I got it from 3rd part websites and don't worry I want to share the dataset with you and you can get it from here:

## Project Overview:

Using Pandas library I loaded the dataset and also check the complete information about the dataset using the same library.
since the data is having no Null values.It become easy for me.
But while focusing then i see there is no use of User_ID columns here so i droped it.

Here i have converted the text data in to numerical as there is only one column that is to be binary .So i used map function

## I am following below Steps :

           - Calories Prediction Project:
           - Collect the data
           - Checking the Data information
           - Understand Problem statement
           - since there is binary data used map function 
           - Need to convert them into numbers:
           - Using matplotlib for data Visualization
           - Scaling
           - varaiable transformation
           - Split the Data
           - Model developement
           - LinearRegression
           - r2_score
           - Read the Model and check once again
           - Using Flask Integrate with HTML and CSS
           - Generate outcome in localhost
           - Deploy in Server
           - API Generation
           - Share our Project API

## why spliting the data:

So here spited the data and balanced the length of X_train,y_train data then apply and develop the model


#### Finally entire data is set ready for Model developement Purpose:
Know I selected LinearRegression for Model developement:

since after training the model I got the results of :

                  - y_train predi : 0.9676004204744926
                  - y_test predi  : 0.9663701348612177
                  - r2_score      : 0.9663701348612177
           

Saving model now.
